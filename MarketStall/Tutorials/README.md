### Notes
- Character limit of price entry is determined by max stack size of currency item
  
    ( ex: Coins max stack size is 999, thus max amount to put an item for sale is 999 )

    ( ex: Amber max stack size is 10, thus max amount to put an item for sale is 99 )
  
    This is to avoid users input being too large
- Organize your player inventory to display available items to put up for sale in the stack size you desire
- Revenue is dispersed in increments of max stack size of currency
  
    ( ex: Coins max stack size is 999, thus you can only extract 999 coins at a time )
  
    ( ex: Amber max stack size is 10, thus you can only extract 10 amber at a time )
